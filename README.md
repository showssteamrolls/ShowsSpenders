Project: Predicting Default Risk in Loans with ML Techinques: XGBoost, Hypertuning, Feature Engineering, etc.

Hi, this project is my trek in exploring all things machine learning–– models & techniques. In predicting how likely credit card users will default on their loans, I've detailed my learning process, the failed/subpar models, the thinking process (best guesses and reflections), and takeaway lessons.

What's Inside:
- Multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.
- Preprocessing steps like scaling, encoding, SMOTE
- Tuning with GridSearch and Optuna
- Interpretability using SHAP
- and much revealed Thought Process and Reflection
